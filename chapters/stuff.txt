Examples of these are Nike+, which 
helps get users active and to change their unhealthy behaviors to 
healthy habits by tracking all 
activity, and letting the user know how much energy has been used. All exercise is turned into 
NikeFuel points, which can be posted on social media sites and used to compete with other users 
(Burke 39

on
-
profit educational organization that helps users learn and 
master math, science, and other school subject skills using gamification to motivate their 
students to view more lessons and explore and develop more skills. With every section mastered, 
users a
re awarded with new sections opening up that they could not access before (Burke 59

The  f
ollowing  sections  will  describe
the 
fundamentals
behind  the  concept  of
G
amification. 
Furthermore, 
G
amification as the intersection of psychology and technology will be explained. 
Most  successful 
Gamification  programs  rely  to  some  extend  on  behavioral  psych
ology. 
Therefore, it is
necessary to understand the motivational triggers 
that 
engage individuals. On 
the other hand, a
thorough
review of what constitute the fundamental parts of 
G
amification 
is 
also included. There are three main purpo
ses of this section. The first 
part is to provide a good 
overview of the subject itself and to introduce te
rms that will be used later in 
the discussion. 
The  second  purpose  is  to  present  theories  that  show  the 
engaging  and  motivating  effect 
of 
games
,  while
the  third  is  to  establish  the  frame  that  constitutes  a  game  that  was  used  when 
designing the 
G
amification system.
Chapter 4
will be built upon this foundation
, attempting 
to 
extend it by
presenting some ground rules based 
upon the 
empirical finding
s
and i
ncorporating 
the perspectives and concerns of change managers and
