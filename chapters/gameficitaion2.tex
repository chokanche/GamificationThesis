\section{Gamification}
Having outlined the basic concepts regarding Warm-up procedures, the following section sheds light 
on the dimensions of Gamification. In order to tie in with the idea of comparing both concepts, after  introducing Gamification in further detail, the emphasis will be placed upon taking a look at the 
gamified solutions in the domain of fitness and health.

In recent years, there have been an tremendous increase in popularity of video games inspired software solutions designed to address issues in variety of functional areas, incentivize consumer behavior or increase motivation and desire for achievement. What these software solutions all have in common is that they are based on the concept of \textit{gamification}. This term has begun to rise in popularity in 2010 (Figure \ref{fig:buzz}), and since then has been a trending topic. %ovde dodaj 
%It has proved to be an effective tool for certain businesses for developing new skills, solve problems, improve results or address.

Gamification is being used and studied in various domains, from education and academic performance to health care, finance, company culture building and recruitment, to name a few \cite{gamificationExamples, gamificationWiki, enterpriseGamify}. Large companies like Nike \cite{nikePlus}, Deloitte \cite{deloitte}, Starbucks \cite{starbucks}, Coca Cola \cite{coke} and Toyota \cite{toyota} have all used gamified solutions in order to increase customer loyalty, change behaviors, 
and drive innovation. %example u STUFF
Moreover, there is an increasing number of startups (e.g. Foursquare, CodeAcademy) that have gamification  at  their  core \cite{codeacademy} or offer assistance to enterprises to gamify their existing services (e.g. Badgeville \cite{badgeville}). Hamari \textit{et al.} reported on an increasing popularity of gamification related researches in the academia \cite{hamari2014does}. Figure \ref{fig:pub} gives an overview of the increase of writing on this topic. The figure includes only the number of publications for every year for the term \textit{Gamification} and excludes patents and citations.

It is worth noticing that the appearance of term Gamification publication titles' has been increasing more rapidly than search hits for the same term (see Figure \ref{fig:buzz}). This suggests that Gamification is becoming more popular in academic circles as a research topic. 
\subsection{Behavioral  Psychology}
\subsection{Defining Gamification}
As  the  term  itself  is  relatively  new,  there  exist  numerous definitions  of  gamification  (Zicherman \&  Cunningham 2011, Kapp 2011, Werbach \& Hunter 2012). Definition by Deterding \textit{et al.} (2011) is currently the most cited definition of gamification in academia and is the definition that is adopeted for this thesis. In their paper the authors proposed a well reasoned definition as follows:
\begin{quotation}
\textit{``Gamification is the use of game design elements in a non-game context.''}
\end{quotation}
There exist references to \textit{gamifying} online systems as early as 1980. Professor Richard Bartle from University of Essex, points out the word referred originally to ``turning something not a game into a game.''\cite{werbach2012win}%ovo je knjiga, daj stranu 
 However, the first use of gamification in its current sense dates back to 2002 by Nick Pelling as part of his consultancy business, but the term did not see widespread adoption before the second half of 2010 \cite{marczewski2013gamification}. In parallel with this term, a verb \textit{to gamify} emerged. It's meaning reffers to applying game mechanics to supercharge user engagement, loyalty and fun \cite{toGamify}. 
It should be noted that the definition outlined by Deterding \textit{et al.} relates to \textit{games} and not \textit{play} \cite{deterding2011game}. %Consequently, the definition distinguieshes between \textit{gamefullness} and \textit{playfullness} ... TODO. 
Even though often used interchangeably, there exists a complex relationship between these two concepts and clear distinction can be made. That is, according to the forms they take in the world, \textit{play} can be interpreted as a broader category that includes \textit{game} as a subset \cite{salen2004rules}. Play is normally assumed to be a free-form activity lacking constraints engaged in for pleasure and amusement rather than a serious or practical purpose, whereas games provide context for actions and are limited in action by fixed rules \cite{juul2011half}. In addition, Salen \& Zimmerman (2004) define game as a system where players engage in an artificial conflict which is defined by rules that limit players behavior and define the game, that can result in a quantifiable outcome or goal \cite{salen2004rules}.%behavioral, game-playing
Games manifest themselves as integrated experiences, but they are built from many smaller pieces often called game elements \cite{werbach2012win}. They represent parts of games used as a building blocks for creating gamified applications, as well as tools and rules that define the overall context of game \cite{gamDesElem}. This means that the definition distinguishes gamification from other systems that employ full-fledged games rather than elements of game design only. Furthermore, it does not include all game elements either, only a subcategory called game design elements that are used as seen the most suitable in current situation. %ova dve poslednje recenice odavde, izmeni

The final aspect of the definition is that gamification operates in non-game contexts. A non-game context refers to applications which main purpose is beyond pure entertainment; using game design elements to a context of ``other than games''. This implies that gamification can be used and successfully applied to almost anything: from business, finance, personal improvement to education, health and fitness \cite{deterding2011game}. Thus, the challenge of gamification, is to select elements that normally operate within the game universe and apply them effectively in the real world.
%Although it is possible to also use gamification in the context  of  games  and  gamify  them,  it  can  simply  be  considered  to  be  a  part  of  designing  a  game.  This  way  specifying  gamification  to  nongame  contexts  is justified. (Deterding et al. 20
The concept of gamification is closely related to similar pre-existing concepts such as serious games, playful design and toys. Thus, the proposed definition aims at separating the concept of gamification from similar phenomena on a two-by-two matrix introduced by Deterding \textit{et al} (2011, Figure \ref{fig:mesh1}). 
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gamification-btw-game-and-play}
    \caption{The matrix distinguishing the concepts related to gamification}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}
In figure \ref{fig:mesh1}, along one axis a distinction between gaming and playing is made, and on the other between whole game and an artifact with game elements. Gameful design or gamification, differs from playful design because the former focuses on activities that are goal oriented and structured by rules, while the latter focuses on activities that are based on improvisation and are free of form. Moreover, gamification is situated in the quadrant involving games and game elements, meaning that gamification makes use of gameful design rather than playful design and game elements rather than full-fledged games. This is different to serious games used also in non-game contexts, a group that includes full games that have been created for reasons other than pure entertainment. 
\subsection{Classification of Game elements}
% \cite{schobel2016agony}.% Sch{\"o}bel \textit{et al.} carried out a literature review to analyze the gamification elements used in various research studies.

%Next, and overview and various classification frameworks of game elements which might further enhance engagement, the potential goal of gamification is presented. 
Tools and rules that define the overall context of game are known as game elements. %from wiki Games
Gamified  applications  make use of game elements that in order to provide a gamified expirience and not to  give  rise entire (full-fledged) games \cite{deterding2011game}. With respect to the use of game elements, gamification studies classified them differently. Derived from the available literature, Deterding \textit{et al.} found that game elements previously identified and presented in different research studies, fell in five distinct levels of abstraction. Table \ref{table:gameElements} present a model for classification of game elements with five levels of abstraction, ordered from concrete to abstract.

On the other hand, Zichermann \& Cunningham (2011) take a different approach and base their description of game elements on the MDA framework, which is categorized as a \textit{game model} in the framework proposed by Deterding \textit{et al.}(2011). It is one of the most frequently used frameworks of game design and stands for \textit{Mechanics}, \textit{Dynamics} and \textit{Aesthetics} \cite{hunicke2004mda}. 
Mechanics are the functioning components that make up the game. They represent the specific elements of the game and the different behaviors and control mechanism that are given to the player within the game's context. Dynamics, on the other side, represent the player’s interactions with the mechanics. They specify how the player reacts to the mechanics of the system, both individually and with other players. Lastly, the aesthetics of the system are the emotional reponses of the user who interact with the game system. \cite{zichermann2011gamification}.

In the next section different mechanics are listed and described according to their relevance and applicability to our context, considering also the  dynamics  and desirable aesthetic outcomes

%First  the  elements  most related   to   motivation   are   presented   and   then   the   most   popular elements   in gamification  literature  are  presented.  Although  all  game  elements  can be  used  in gamification they might not all be equally relevant. Some are more potent and useful than others. As it is also a goal of this paper to examine which elements are the most  relevant,  based  on  the  research  done  on  motivational  theory  and  gamification literature a distinction is made.

\subsection{Gamification of Health and Fitness}
%Gamification in Health and Fitness has rapidly emerged over the past decade as a tool to promote health and wellness. It is a broad term referring to the use of game thinking and game mechanics in a non-game context to engage users and solve problems. The concept is used to incentivise users to achieve their goals and increase user engagement. The best examples of gamification are in the Health and Fitness industry, where games encourage exercise by turning physical activity into a game and by delivering health interventions for bad habits cessation, like smoking, overeating or poor hydration, and medication adherence. Application of mobile and wearable devices have proven to be effective platforms for health and fitness games due to its wide adaptation, ease of use and continuous proximity to the users and patients. Since gamification can be applied to almost any business model, serious or not, for this thesis, we restrict our concern of gamification to the solving of serious issues. In particular, we are focused on gamification of education and behavior change related to the serious world issue of childhood obesity
