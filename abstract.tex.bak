\abstract{Past research related to exergames has found that they can help to motivate people to exercise by converting physical activity into an enjoyable game.  However, these exergames have been single purpose usually fitness only. In this thesis, we designed an exergame for warm up guidance and motivation. This exergame is designed to be used in gyms and fitness centers before physically more strenuous exercise. We utilized immersive technologies based on the hypothesis that they can be used as a guiding tool for warm up procedures and would improve motivation to engage in warm up procedures more often. By making the game interactive and appealing, with intervals that last as long as the player chooses to, the warm up procedure undergoes a shift from a repetitive and tiresome activity to an entertaining and challenging necessity. In order to evaluate our exergame, we conduced a user study comparing warm up procedure without a game to a warm up procedure with two versions of the game: one using the Kinect sensor, and one displayed on a screen. The usage of the exergame, with or without the Kinect sensor showed a small but statistically significant increase in exercise performance relative to the non-gaming condition, with the screen condition faring slightly better than the Kinect condition. The exergame showed a significant increase in user motivation and enjoyment when compared to the non gaming condition, with the Kinect condition found to be slightly more motivating than the screen condition.
