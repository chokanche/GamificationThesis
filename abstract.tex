\abstract{Past research related to exergames has found that they can help to motivate people to exercise by converting physical activity into an enjoyable game. However, these exergames have been single purpose usually home fitness only. In this thesis, we designed an exergame for warm up guidance to be used in gyms and fitness centers before physically more strenuous exercise. We utilized immersive technologies based on the hypothesis that they can be used as a guiding tool for warm up procedures, would increase warm up duration, and increase exercise enjoyment.  In order to evaluate our exergame we have conducted two user studies. The first was an online study where we collected responses from 466 participants about their work out and warm up habits. For the second study we utilized a between-subject laboratory experiment with two conditions: (a) warming up by following a video with a fitness instructor performing a warm up session; (b) warming up by interacting with our exergame solution. The results showed a statistically significant increase of exercise duration, enjoyment of the physical activity, and participant's momentary feeling of pleasure relative to the non-gaming condition. 
%Based on our findings from both the studies, we concluded that by making the exergame interactive and appealing it is possible to transform the warm up procedure from a repetitive and tiresome activity to an entertaining and challenging necessity.% The exergame showed a significant increase in user motivation and enjoyment when compared to the non gaming condition, with the Kinect condition found to be slightly more motivating than the screen condition.
