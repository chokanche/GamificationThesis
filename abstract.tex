\abstract{Past research related to exergames has found that they can help to motivate people to exercise by converting physical activity into an enjoyable game. However, these exergames have been single purpose usually home fitness only. In this thesis, we designed an exergame for warm up guidance to be used in gyms and fitness centers before physically more strenuous exercise. We utilized immersive technologies based on the hypothesis that they can be used as a guiding tool for warm up procedures, would increase warm up duration, and increase exercise enjoyment.  In order to evaluate our exergame we have conducted two user studies. The first was an online study where we collected responses from 466 participants about their work out and warm up habits.  For the second study we utilized a between-subject laboratory experiment with 10 participants and two conditions: (a) warming up by following a video with a fitness instructor guiding through a warm up session; (b) warming up by interacting with our exergame solution. The results from the exergame condition showed a statistically significant increase in exercise duration, enjoyment of the physical activity, and participant's momentary feeling of pleasure relative to the non-gaming condition. 
In summary, the experiment results and survey responses demonstrated that the Immotion exergame effectively guided amateur athletes through a general warm up procedure by utilizing immersive technologies and an appealing game design.
